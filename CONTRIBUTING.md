# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in contributing!

- Bug reports / feature requests: open an issue and include hardware used (Arduino UNO R3, HCâ€‘SR04, servo model), wiring, and exact behavior.
- Pull requests:
  - Branch from main: `feature/your-feature`.
  - Describe changes and testing steps (board, port, expected output).
- If contributing firmware, include wiring comments in the sketch header and explain assumptions (e.g., RGB common-cathode vs common-anode).
- By contributing you agree to license contributions under the project license (MIT).
